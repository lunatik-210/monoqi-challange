Forms are light, delicate, and despite the strong\r\ngeometrical shapes – comfortable and functional, with clear and raw simplicity.\r\nEach form is handcrafted of stainless steel, silver or gold with the utmost attention towards detail following the idea\r\nthat simple is beautiful and less is more."

An armchair that transmits its comfort in an irresistible, almost telepathic manner, a lamp that emits its light. Tables, coffee tables, round, oval, large, small. Mirrors, candlesticks and lamps reflect beams of light and shade like in a dream. Then there are vases, boxes, containers and trays to hold life’s everyday items. Every object is contextualised to last in time, to stir the emotions: if merely displayed they would only lose their poetry. And so they pose and wait, dialogue with the others, a study in consistency and simplicity: underneath there is a common thread that unites them.\r\n\r\nUnconventional aesthetics\r\nAtipico is a project that breaks the mould of design and makes it part of everyday life. Strictly ‘made in Italy’, it seeks to make every aspect of our daily lives more beautiful. No traces of immobility, a continuous flux of ideas and relations, an amalgam of visions: decorative aspects and functionality form an indissoluble union. Fusions of materials - cement, cork, fabric, iron, glass - result in a minimalist, highly elegant aesthetic.\r\n\r\nWe choose people, not just ideas\r\nThere is continuous research behind the Atipico project, a rewarding dialogue with young designers, a rich exchange of ideas, a joint effort that brings together visions, concepts, practices, techniques. Suggestions stem from personal paths, from a preference for this or that material, from the inventions of a specific moment. Everything is fertile, never seen, embraced and compared with the Atipico philosophy and its passion for design. The result are objects designed for those that are looking for something new, different in form and functionality, consistent in their strength, in their beauty, protagonists of a lifestyle that is different, better."

Inspired by the available space on the walls of their apartment, they began conceptualizing functional products to accommodate their needs for storage. Once the apartment was fully furnished their creativity needed an outlet and that's where \"agustav\" came to life. Multipurpose furniture and items with an edge to their function is a keynote in their design process. It's the beauty in the offbeat that makes up their drive and what centers the whole company.\r\nCurrently located in Denmark they hand-build each and every item in their workshop in Copenhagen.\r\n\r\nThe current collection is comprised of uniform multipurpose house-ware items designed to lighten and brighten everyday living. Each item’s foundation is a wall mounted piece, the rack itself. Each piece is designed to be able to take on any type of pin. In that way today’s book rack can double as tomorrow’s coat – or bed side rack; simply by mixing and matching the pins to suit whatever purpose fits best for the specific space it is placed in. The racks are designed to complement the items they carry and in their minimalism work as a stylish addition to any home.\r\n"

          "brand_copy_description": "AMAZONAS was founded in 1995 and is the biggest wholesaler of hammocks, stands and accessories in Europe and among the top manufacturers of hammocks worldwide. Since almost 20 years we constantly follow our maxim to provide the best quality at an attractive price!\r\nAMAZONAS Headquarter is located in the near of Munich, Germany. We additionally run an office in Shanghai, China. Furthermore, the production plant in Brazil is our own factory. Together with a Brazilian, we bought the complex in 1996, renovated the buildings and purchased new modern weaving looms. The pace of growth was so fast that, in 2002, the old buildings were torn down and replaced by a new, state-of-the-art production hall. The modern hall has been equipped with additional looms and a new dust extraction system to ensure a dust-free working environment. As the factory works exclusively for us, the cooperation between the production in Brazil and our head office in Germany is very close.\r\nWe visit the production facility several times a year, which enables us to regularly verify the working conditions and product quality in the Amazonas manufacture. We guarantee that only skilled adults are employed there—so that their children have the chance to attend school regularly!\r\nThe export of AMAZONAS hammocks today provides more than 100 workers with a secure job. The majority of them is paid two to three times the minimum legal wage, which offers them and their families a steady income. In addition, they enjoy social standards which are largely unheard of in the rural areas of Brazil, such as social security, health insurance and paid holidays. Exports to Europe provide further benefits for the workers. The quality of the raw materials we use corresponds to European standards.\r\nThe environmental compatibility of the dyes used does not just help the rivers and streams in Brazil, but also means a healthy working environment for the workers who process the dyed cotton. Also, ear muffs for hearing protection are used practically nowhere else except in our factory. In order to ensure the high quality of our products, we furthermore have our hammocks analysed at regular intervals for azo dyes, heavy metals, formaldehyde and other pollutants. As environment protection is one of our core principles, we use a straightforward technique to turn remnants back into yarn. Because the fibers are shorter than during the original process, they are stabilized by adding a maximum of 15 % polyester threads. Only materials are used in which the dyes have been strictly monitored (for example, tested for skin sensitivity). That's why we at AMAZONAS produce our (coloured) hammocks this way – and help preserve the world's natural resources and protect the environment. In order to complement the regular quality checks performed by independent test institutes on our behalf, AMAZONAS has installed its own test bench in its office premises in Gräfelfing. This test bench, which has been specially developed to test the load-bearing capacity of hammocks, hanging chairs and stands, enables a maximum stress test of up to 600 kg (by means of filled sand sacks in 10 kg increments). We are thus now able to test new models for their load-bearing capacity ourselves, while existing tests of currently marketed hammocks and hanging chairs will of course continue to be performed. In this way, we are able to guarantee the special quality of our products on a constant basis. Last but not least we donate every year € 20.000 to \"The Little Nazareno Association\", an aid project for street children of Fortaleza, Northeast Brazil. Our contribution benefits the children directly. So you can relax with complete peace of mind and don ́t forget... Hammocks make you happy!\r\n"

The organic aspects of my designs add a soft and sculptural feel to the metal that fit into all kinds of interior”\r\n\r\nAnne Linde lives in Hellerup, Copenhagen with her husband Christian and their two children.\r\n\r\n"

The building is classified as one of the historic monuments in PARIS.It dates from the 17th century. At one time it used to be a cabaret.\r\nThe restaurant was specialized in provencal cooking, using olive oil, aromatic herbs, garlic, etc... It was one of the first restaurants to offer grilled meats seasoned with Provence herbs, as the LOMBARD family originally came from Provence. It was very fashionable to frequent this restaurant in the 60's, where you could meet celebrities such as Salvador Dali, who signed a small Provence herbs crock, as well as Brigitte Bardot, Jerry Lewis, ...\r\nAt the end of his/her dinner, each customer was offered a small gift : the small «Herbes de Provence» crock, special blend prepared by LOUIS LOMBARD, who was the first to include lavender flowers in the aromatic herbs.\r\nThe success of this little crock gave us the idea to produce and commercialize a line of speciality items packed in clay and stoneware pots. They are made in a small village in the Drôme, near VALENCE (south of LYON). \r\nWe create our own recipes: special blends of aromatic herbs and spices, mustards, vinegars, marinated olives, olive oil with herbs, sea-salts and aromatic pepper with herbs, teas, honeys, flavored sugars, chocolate fondues... The crocks and bottles are filled up by hand.\r\nOlive oil amphoras and vinegar bottles are closed with a wax seal. It is a craftmanship production, original and exclusive."

We have spoken to musicians and studio recorders who all love the fact that more people listen to music in more places, but hate the fact that the quality of the listening experience has been eroded. We want to provide the opportunity to experience media in a convenient and easy way but still in outstanding high quality.\r\n\r\nOUR HERITAGE\r\n\r\nFirmly grounded in our 88 year history in Bang & Olufsen, we interpret the same core values for a new type of contemporary products: \r\n\r\nDesign         \r\nWe seek design that matters. Design that naturally makes our products express how they want to be used. To us, design is not just the beautiful shape we wrap our technology in. Our design approach flows through all aspects of product development – from crystalizing the fundamental user needs in early concept development through the engineering phases. This allows us to deliver products where we never compromise on the basic product idea.\r\n\r\nPerformance  \r\nWe deliver best sound and acoustic performance in our class of products – natural and balanced to best reproduce the emotions that the artist wanted to convey.\r\n\r\nHumanization\r\nWe adapt technology to fit human needs, not the other way around.\r\n\r\nCraftsmanship\r\nWe are always honest in our material choices and pay attention to every detail in the design and assembly."

We envisage smart and creative solutions for indoor farming in urban environments all year round.\r\n\r\nBulbo designs and produces highly innovative LED lights for growing vegetables, herbs, flowers and succulents at home. Our products are beautifully crafted and incredibly easy to use. They perfectly match the natural element and combine functionality, advanced technology and Made in Italy top class design.\r\n\r\nAfter several years of scientific research and experimentation, in 2012, Bulbo won the Spinner European competition which provides funds to young entrepreneurs in order to promote research and create business opportunities in the field of technology. From the very beginning we tried to apply the same principles both to agriculture and industry by looking for smart solutions for industrial production in times of crisis. The entire production process is made in Italy, working along with specialised artisans and using high quality materials only.\r\n\r\nThe project, which started in 2009 as a technological research in the Industrial Design Faculty at the Politecnico di Milano, has developed its scientific research in collaboration with Research Center in Urban Enviroment for Agriculture and Biodiversity, Department of Agricultural Sciences, University of Bologna – Alma Mater Studiorum."

With and sensitive eye, it directs and manages research that ranges from the skilful uses of materials to the giving body to the voices of designers, permitting itself an occasion to go with an ironic spirit into the field of experimentation, without overstepping the limit into useless showmanship. The fantasy of form and attention to materials become the protagonists and the final product shines with a fresh and extremely personal aesthetic without sacrificing functionally. A strong identity founded on a primary need of feasibilty, a harmonius marriage of form and content, a brand capable of seducing and conquering the attention of an ever more vast public thanks to the unceasing serch for a point of balance, in real and not apparent terms."

It was impossible to get the ceiling rose to fit right. With an interest in interior design, this was a disturbing element in an otherwise fully satisfactory kitchen. The actual idea of being able to turn a ceiling rose inside out came to our designer Lars Wettre while he was trying to sleep. The morning after he started work with making a rose that could be turned inside out so as to meet all the demands placed on a ceiling rose. Lars and his colleague Jonas Forsman worked together in developing the innovative and multiple awarded function and design of the ceiling rose, which received the name CableCup. \r\n\r\nWe are careful with quality at all steps and the material is the most important factor for the product’s function. Due to this, considerable emphasis has been put on choosing the right material and the right supplier – a supplier with the necessary skills for transforming the material into the finished product. Production is conducted in Sweden by experienced injection moulders using modern machinery. Assembly is on our premises and each product is inspected for quality at least twice before being placed in shop packaging. They are then packed and sent out to our resellers."

It’s no surprise then that Coloud headphones was born and is based in Stockholm, Sweden.\r\nFrom the very beginning the idea was to create robust headphones that provide no-nonsense sound. No huge logos, no funny gimmicks, no unnecessary details, just reliable and functional headphones designed to deliver your daily dose of music.\r\nOur headphones are crafted with minimal parts and feature a mechanical construction, making them super durable and built to withstand the pressures of everyday listening. What we do add to our headphones, however, are useful features such as the Tangle-Free System.\r\nFrom the logo to the packaging to the angles in the headphone design, triangularity is a theme that runs throughout all Coloud products. The inspiration behind this triangle is the Play symbol, denoting the brand’s mantra – always ready to play when you are.\r\nColoud cares about the environment. This means we comply with standards such as RoHS and REACH. All our products are phthalate and PVC free, and we use packaging that is 100 percent recyclable.\r\nColoud – always ready to play when you are."

And while we wish we’d been inspired while sipping warmish wine in an icicle-rimmed Aspen chalet, that’s not the case. The truth is that Ben Hewitt, Corkcicle’s inventor and company founder, simply loves wine and hated that there wasn’t a better solution to bothersome wine buckets.\r\n\r\nIn November 2011, Ben started tinkering in his garage making prototype after prototype. \r\n\r\nAided with the marketing expertise of his friend and business partner, Stephen Bruner, the idea quickly became a reality. More to the point, Stephen brought a high design approach to the product with the name and its icicle form to create our beloved Corkcicle.\r\n\r\nAs the manufacturing process got underway, it became clear that we needed a rainmaker to help deliver the product and get it effectively introduced to the retail world. A close friend, Eric Miller, VP of Sales at a Fortune 100 medical device company, came on board and has been making it rain Corkcicles ever since.\r\n\r\nTogether, the three have built a brand that represents true American ingenuity and captures the essence of the entrepreneurial spirit. Proving that great ideas still matter and that with hard work and great partners, anything’s possible."

We create an innovative range of functional home and garden accessories which evoke traditional style. Our outlet is mainly through independent retailers across the UK and overseas.\r\n\r\nEstablished by John Buckland in 1981, operations began in a ten foot square former wash house at the family’s previous home with a handful of tools and a wood lathe, and working locally sourced timber. Through this initial period a selection of designs came to the fore and developed the focus of the business.\r\n\r\nHaving soon run out of space the family moved to Creamore Mill which was formerly both a corn and wood mill dating back many generations. Taking on the Mill in a state of disrepair was a great opportunity, and the renovations carried out revived the Mills past association with woodworking and turning.\r\n\r\nSteady improvement led to more mechanisation which is tempered by the high degree of hand work still practiced. Seeing progress from design through to despatch under one roof holds the artisan approach true.\r\n\r\nJohn’s wife Cathryn and their five sons have provided much input over the years and son Sam now shares a leading role. Together with them, long time employee Justin Powell is a key figure in production method and design application.\r\n\r\nWith three decades of experience and many design originals under our belt, Creamore Mill continues to enjoy the support of its many advocates as a family concern.\r\n"

Not willing to stop there, Parren has taken his luminescent experimentation in a whole other direction: wanting to create lighting at once technically innovative and universally accessible, the designer's Bird Collection models three feathered forms in matte polypropylene, for puzzle-like LED lights with movable pieces that can be combined and adjusted.

The wish to develop an own product, from the idea to the design and production, without being bound to external opinions from customers, was on their minds for quite a while. Especially the products which are unimposing on the first sight were in their focus as they were providing a special attraction to design them different and beautifully – like a multiple socket. \r\nGrohmann explains: “While shopping I realized the loveless design of multiple sockets, which I didn’t want to use. I wanted something different. That’s how we came to the idea of designing our own object”. For the actual development and production they needed an experienced partner with the technical know-how. Frank Trentmann was the right one - a producer of plastic injection moldings. \r\nIn the upcoming development phase the product designer Ämilios Grohmann and the architect Andre Kieker attached great importance to aesthetics – the object was meant to get from under the table on the table. \r\nThe ‘diamondplug’ offers 2 USB connections with 2 Ampere power each and 4 flat-pin plugs 230V with a multiple socket in an innovative design which is produced of high-value. It can be used many-sided like charging all electronically devices with USB, iPhones, tablets etc. "

After a distinguished career fighting fires and saving lives the hoses were destined for landfill. Elvis & Kresse started to rescue this material in 2005 and never looked back. Many have called them an 'ethical luxury brand' and even names such as Donna Karan New York have begun carrying pieces in their shops and Cameron Diaz was spotted wearing one of Elvis & Kresse's belts in Vogue.\r\n\r\nAfter scrubbing away the soot and grease that builds up on the hose after 25 years of active duty and discovered a truly remarkable, truly green textile. The designers wanted to honour this tough, life saving material, hence their focus on quality craftsmanship and classic, timeless design. They build as much value as they can into each piece and style them for use beyond single seasons. All Elvis & Kresse products are hand-made and unique."

Jørgen Rasmussen has designed the Kevi chair. Kasper Salto has designed the Kato sofa and lounge chair.\r\nWorking with such skilled and talented designers has resulted in a furniture line that lives up to Engelbrechts basic idea, which is to cultivate a pure line in concept and design. To choose some of the best materials combine the best of both craft and industry and hold firmly onto finish and functional requirements have resulted in quite a success for Engelbrechts.\r\nIt is our belief that our products are being best represented by exclusivity i.e. few but good dealers. Therefore Engelbrechts' products are being sold from carefully selected dealers who have the same concept about design and quality as we do."

Research was and is an important factor for the company's success, just as the employment of technical innovations. Excellent collaborations with internationally renowed designers like Pier Giacomo Castiglioni, Achille Castiglioni and Tobia Scarpa led FLOS to exhibit its products at some of the most important museums for design, for instance at the MoMa in New York. Thanks to a number of exclusive showrooms and by the means of well calculated buyouts of third companies, like the Italian \"Arteluce italiana\" and the Spanish \"Antares\", FLOS managed to establish itself on the international market. Several of its products received prestigious prizes: the lamp Parentesi, by Achille Castiglioni e Pio Manzù, Drop and May Day, for instance, were awarded with the highly respected Compasso D’oro."

          "brand_copy_description": "Inspired by stories of his father’s inter-war life spent in the coffee houses of Central Europe, where coffee, beer, culture and conversation flowed hand in hand, David Freud founded FREUD design and café-bars in 1986. With the aim of bringing the bustle and chatter of his father’s treasured Viennese hang-outs to London, his first venture was to create the first café-bar in England – Freud on Shaftesbury Avenue – a retreat where one can chose from a single menu, ordering food, coffee and alcohol in a striking but relaxed environment. More than that, it was an experiment. Not only did it sell drink and, through the inter-locking café and shop spaces, design. It also offered a change in the way we interact with each other and the world around us.\r\n\r\nGraduating from the Courtauld Institute of Art in 1973, David’s passion for the ideas behind the way things look carries through into every aspect of FREUD, his preoccupation with the virtues of lasting design being seen not only in the beautiful table and glassware products created by the design house, but also in the FREUD buildings, which house the enterprise. At 198 Shaftesbury Avenue, home of the original café-bar, gallery and shop spaces, black, green and grey slate are juxtaposed against cement, York stone and steel – a concept which looks back to the past, from Medieval cloisters to Baroque architecture, for inspiration – but not imitation. This is a reflection of David’s belief that we should use the past as a ‘library of ideas’ to inform and enrich our imaginations, an idea which remains at the heart of our thinking and creations.\r\n\r\nTwenty-six years after opening its doors and being discovered by a London crowd who made it their own, FREUD has continued naturally to evolve. So too has the Freud family, bringing fresh ideas to the project. In Oxford, at the Freud café David’s eldest son is working with a new team to renew the spirit of café society. In London, his daughter has\r\njoined the design team to refresh its creativity."

The line has expanded to include a full assortment of canvas and leather bags and accessories, all of which incorporate this same combination of a timeless, tomboy aesthetic, purposeful construction and refined details. \r\n\r\nProcess:\r\nGuided by Shira and Alex’s backgrounds in fashion design and by their appreciation for craftsmanship, each bag is designed in our Brooklyn studio and is hand-made in the USA. Many of our products are made in Limited Edition, in small runs of 20 to 200. We think of each bag as an artist edition, thus many products are hand-numbered and silkscreened with the production number. \r\n\r\nMaterials: \r\nWe use natural, high quality materials that are aligned with sustainable production. Most of our products are made with 100% cotton canvases, waxed cotton canvases and vegetable-tanned leathers. All silk-screening is done in Brooklyn using water-based ink.  \r\n\r\nNatural Dyeing: \r\nNatural dyes are derived mainly from plants, but from minerals and animals as well, and can range in color from muted brown to bright magenta. Natural dyeing requires a lot of time, practice and patience, and is both a scientific and artistic endeavor. We have been exploring natural dyes in order to color our vegetable-tanned leathers in an environmentally-friendly way. Please stay tuned as we look to offer naturally-dyed products in the future."

What do you have inside that you don’t have outside? Attractive outdoor furniture and accessories have been around for years, but charming outdoor lighting was scarce. Following a series of sketches, the design gradually took shape, resulting in an elegant yet robust garden lamp with a stylish cover for outdoor use.\r\nInnovative, new, different, retro and comfort were the key words to describe this new lamp, and following a two-year development phase, the GACOLI was ready to enter the market as the most innovative and smart outdoor lighting on the market.\r\nGACOLI stands for Garden Comfort Living: Beautiful garden lights for everyone. However, is comfort merely about the light output? Hems didn’t believe so.\r\nLaying of cables is always an expensive task and makes it impossible to easily move the conventional garden lamps around. His answer to this question was the EMU (Energy Management Unit), a high-tech, compact panel integrated onto the top of every GACOLI cover, which both gathers energy via solar panels and lights the lamp cover and surrounding area with powerfull warm white LEDs. Wiring is no longer necessary and the lamps can be moved around at will. GACOLI outdoor lamps are wireless and therefore are not bound to a fixed spot. Now that’s user-friendliness! GACOLI lamps are powered by daylight, so using GACOLI outdoor lights in your garden is a sustainable, responsible choice."

          "brand_copy_description": "GREYGE [greij] is the new design brand from Rome. For Greyge design lives in the details: every material, line and angle has a tangible relevance. Every single piece follows its own vision. All original designs are manufactured by hand in Italy and inspired by a passion for visual lightness. In 2011, the design team Kathrin Charlotte Bohr and Mauro Falomi began producing their own interior line while restoring a 1950's apartment in Monteverde, Roma. The idea of Greyge is rooted in a strong commitment to lightness of form and seeks to marry the suggestive force of fluctuating lines and the emotion of color. \r\nThe designs take their inspiration both from architectural components found in nature and the emotional response they can generate. Sensations such as appear in an old growth forest, like rustling tree crowns or playful reflections of natural light are materialized in the designs. Thin metal bars and smoothly shaped wood are employed to convey a sense of material weightlessness. Kathrin's fascination with the lily plant inspired Calla, a pendant light molded from thin steel plates. Two outstretched arms ending in lily-shaped forms embrace the space with unexpected luminosity: on one side an opened calla blossom functions as an indirect light source reflecting from the ceiling while the other shape focuses the light to the side. Transforming the classical ceiling lamp into a charming lighting mobile, CALLA is employable as turn-able reading spot and living room light, as unconventional dining table illumination or on free inspiration for new senses of individual interior design. \r\nTED is a table that maintains a strong devotion to the core lines and form of the Italian walnut tree, integrating the natural beauty of its wood grain into a rounded table top with a triangular form. Three legs lift the unique shape to harmonize the strength of the raw material with the pleasure of lightness. The chair IBSEN plays with the irony of its namesake, the idea of continuous questioning of the rules of construction and material expectations. A surreal play with the plurality of ideas mingles the notion of grace and comfort. An extravagant harmony between different characters: an elastic ballerina and a charming poet. The designers' working experience in set design, as both director and director of photography, supports the idea of conveying a space emotionally and individually. The pieces are not conceived on paper, but molded, destroyed and rebuilt by hand until their true soul takes life and their story shines through. When the objects are placed together, their characters play off each other in suggestive compositions with a personal perspective. \r\nGREYGE. TO FURNISH PLEASURE.\r\n"

We have 10 years’ work-experience in the field of advertising, with our partnership morganmorell, and throughout the years we have received a number of prestigious prizes and diplomas.\r\n\r\nAt hagedornhagen we have a passion for creeps and tiny winged creatures. For this reason, we have collected, prepared and photographed selected types of beetles and butterflies, and created a series of artprints of very high quality, as regards to both craftsmanship and artistry. Each artprint has been produced in a limited edition of 2000 copies. We have photographed the insects with a High End camera, which reproduces the colours and details of the motive most convincingly, and we have spent a lot of care on printing techniques and choice of paper. A hagedornhagen artprint is, in short, a product that has been carefully prepared and carried through down to the minutest details.\r\n\r\nThe artprints have a look that conjures up visions of old silk screen prints with nature motives. They simply buzz with nostalgia and poetry. At the same time, the photographs express innovation and modernity due to their graphic simplicity and illustrative sharpness. The artprints will look good in modern homes, where furniture classics are mixed with vibrant vintage artefacts. They will also look fine with a drawing pin in each corner, fixed on the wall in the children’s bedroom.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to posting your first hagedornhagen\"\r\n"

De Pree had been working at the company, which opened in 1905, since he was hired in 1909 as a clerk. De Pree knew his father-in-law was a man of integrity, so he decided to rename the company after him.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of the 20th century, the name Herman Miller had become synonymous with “modern” furniture. Working with legendary designers George Nelson and Charles and Ray Eames, the company produced pieces that would become classics of industrial design.\r\n\r\nSince then, we’ve collaborated with some of the most outstanding designers in the world, including Alexander Girard, Isamu Noguchi, Robert Propst, Bill Stumpf, Don Chadwick, Ayse Birsel, Studio 7.5, Yves Béhar, Doug Ball, and many talented others.\r\n\r\nToday, in addition to our classic pieces and new designs for the home, Herman Miller is a recognized innovator in contemporary interior furnishings, solutions for healthcare environments, and related technologies and services. A publicly held company headquartered in Zeeland, Michigan, we have manufacturing facilities in the United States, China, Italy, and the United Kingdom and sales offices, dealers, licensees, and customers in over 100 countries.\r\n\r\nWe operate through several focused businesses, brands, and distribution channels, including Herman Miller, Herman Miller Healthcare, Nemschoff, Geiger International, and independently owned dealerships. All of them work to design and build a better world around you."

          "brand_copy_description": "The identity of HÄNSKA comes from our hearts. Growing organically since the launch of the original CATAMARAN Rucksack in 2013, we have gradually expanded our range of products along with our team.\r\nThe creative marriage of industrial-, product- and fashion design within our team gives us the means to explore and to create products using our wide range of expertise. Every design is realized with unconventional rules of construction. We give ourselves space for experimentation, allowing for chance encounters that bring forth a new aesthetic language. We find inspiration in traditional packaging elements and combine them with a love for geometric shapes. We are always in search of new materials, which change the direction of subtle details in the final product. We design our items with a new generation of active, creative users in mind; users whose daily journeys seamlessly move from urban to outdoor environments, where work and adventure melt into one.\r\nAll our products are handmade in our Berlin-based Studio by talented craftsmen/women. Producing right inside our design studio is an invaluable aspect of our approach, as we can be in constant communication with one another, allowing the production process to flourish.\r\nWe believe in using only high-quality materials that are certified, made to last and as locally sourced as possible. The linen we use is grown and woven in Germany, a real rarity nowadays. The acrylic fabric, which is completely water-repellent, colourfast and extremely durable, is made in France and has been approved by the Oeko Tex Standard. The high-tech mesh, normally used for Catamaran trampolines and outdoor furniture, is made in Switzerland and is 100% recyclable and also meets the Oeko Tex Standard. All leather parts are naturally tanned and come from Portugal.\r\n\r\nOrigin: Germany"

Famed for it’s traditional technique of producing small leather goods with the word “bussetto” coming from the name of an instrument used by craftsman to polish cuoio leather. Looking to traditional Artisan craftsmanship the brand has re-introduced an ancient technique used to produce cuoio leather goods completely devoid of any seams but where the leather is molded into shape. Staying true to this tradition, classic styles are updated for the modern day from I-phone cases, through to wallets, glasses, pen, coin and cigar cases which are all given a modern twist. All available in a myriad of colourways from bottle green, vibrant orange, mustard, deep purples, red, bright cobalt blue to minimal brown and black. Not only does the ancient Italian technique allow for the creation of complex objects without permitting any seams, the products are completely handmade to ensure the highest quality from the leather, design, manufacturing through to production. All materials from leather, colourings, glues and waxes are completely natural. The cuoio calf leather is tanned using vegetable products derived from trees such as chestnut or quebracho; the colours are diluted in water and alcohol in order to be easily absorbed without leaving any trace on the final product. The glue used is derived from rice, also ensuring all materials are from a natural source. The leather is first cut into sections, drenched with water and stretched on wooden shapes to dry for several days. After this initial process has been completed the leather is hand-painted, brushed with a heated “bussetto” then finally liberally waxed and buffed to a glowing luster. The premium collection stays true to artisan craftsmanship but includes a covering of luxury leathers such as stringray and ostrich. Classic pieces are featured combining precious and cuoio leather for a truly luxurious product. Il Bussetto produce luxury perennial classics perfect for the modern traveller to everyday use. The collection has also recently expanded to include high quality belts in cuoio leather and stingray."

We achieved a beautifully rich texture in the 'Rope' through innovative weaving techniques and introduced a crisp colour palate inspired by denim and linen. The colour-block designs within the 'Square' are livened up with strategically placed gold accents.\r\n \r\nSS'15 is a very clean and refined collection, with a bit of an edge. Throughout the collection, you'll find details using geometric lava rocks and a  limited edition 'industrial fringe'.\r\n \r\nArguably our most exciting news of the season is the worldwide launch of the first ever, Industrial Jewellery Men's Collection. As a response to many client requests, we have released a capsule collection for the modern man. Building from our signature aesthetics, the Men's line features necklaces, bracelets, cufflinks and a key chain.\r\n \r\nWe see SS'15 as our most innovative work to-date, pushing our creativity to the limit as we enter our 11th season, showcasing in London, New York, Paris and Copenhagen.

Their first concept project Maintenance - a modular cleaning system - was exhibited in London in July 2010, and went on to receive a Wallpaper* Design Award in January 2011. Based on the success of this project, the pair set up studio together under the name International.\r\n\r\nThe studio was selected to take part in D3 Contest 2012 at IMM Köln. Here Grasby and Bell were presented with an Interior Innovation Award by the German Design Council for their new project Apollo. The lighting system was in production the following year and the brand International has since begun to grow as the commercial producer of the studio's own projects.\r\n\r\nAdaptability and a focus on standardised fittings are strong directives throughout International's practice. The studio's ethos serves to impart added value and longevity to functional products by presenting frequent opportunity for user customisation. They simultaneously work to simplify fabrication through innovation in universal manufacturing processes, whilst upholding a restrained and economic use of materials."

Sofa by day, bed by night - versatile and functional futon sofa-sleepers are ideal in that extra room for overnight guests, or as a primary sofa or bed anywhere in your home. Comfort, simplicity and space-saving efficiency are qualities that appeal to young and old alike.\r\nThe furniture from KARUP are designed for your first home, the teen-age room, guest room or vacation house.\r\nThe company KARUP was founded in 1972 by the entrepreneur Preben Christensen. Packed with ideas of how to change the way of producing furniture, he started out in an old farm house. As one of the first producers in Europe of knock-down furniture, the business grew rapidly, and soon he had to find new and more efficient locations for the factory. The production was relocated to the city of Karup, right in the centre of Denmark.\r\nIn beginning of the 80’s, Preben discovered the Hippie-type futon frame in America, and believed there was also a marked for this type of furniture in Europe, and that’s how the first series-production of futon frames came alive in Europe.\r\n \r\nToday, second generation of the family has taken over the management of the company. Some values, how ever, remain sacred to our company. Our product development, which by the way is still lead by the founder, Preben, is still devoted to the space-saving concept. The main-production of the frames remain at factories in Denmark and Estonia, which makes it so much easier to meet the ethical code of conduct of our company ;-)\r\nOur furniture are sold across the globe. Whether you live in Europe, Japan, Singapore, Middle East or the States, we will be able to find you a dealer in your area."

          "brand_copy_description": "KaiGami’s Ethos and Mission Statement.\r\n\r\nKaiGami's aim is to design, develop and manufacture functional, aesthetically\r\n\r\npleasing, innovative and affordable products, while also exploring premium\r\n\r\nmaterials in order to create works for the design­conscious, luxury market.\r\n\r\nWe believe that success depends on three factors,: Innovation, Quality and\r\n\r\nDelivery. This is why KaiGami produces 90% of\r\n\r\nits designs at its manufacturing facility, using Laser Cutting technology. This\r\n\r\nenables KaiGami to offer bespoke production in\r\n\r\none­offs or batch production, thereby maintaining quality.\r\n\r\nWe aim to become a globally recognised brand, known for producing\r\n\r\nseriously top­quality, imaginative\r\n\r\nworks of art, in design.\r\n\r\nOur motto is best described in these simple words ... \"The world\r\n\r\naround you creates you: fill it with beauty”.\r\n\r\nKaiGami is dedicated to reducing its carbon footprint, so where possible it\r\n\r\nmanufactures its designs in the UK, in its production facility based in Lewes, East\r\n\r\nSussex.\r\n\r\nA Concept For Creation\r\n\r\nKaiGami (KG) draws inspiration from an ancient art form.\r\n\r\nWhile KG's approach to creating design objects is similar, it produces its own\r\n\r\nunique\r\n\r\nstyle, as this short history explains.\r\n\r\nOrigami ­ Invented in the Far East ­ China AD 100\r\n\r\nThe name KaiGami was inspired by the ancient art form known as origami.\r\n\r\nWhile the precise origins are obscure, it is believed that origami was created in AD\r\n\r\n100,\r\n\r\nshortly after the invention of papermaking by T'sai Lun, and later spread to Japan\r\n\r\nin\r\n\r\naround AD 600. KG follows the principle of origami in the idea that one can create\r\n\r\nan\r\n\r\nobject from a flat piece of malleable material.\r\n\r\nBut that's where KG evolves away from origami, since KG creates objects that go\r\n\r\nbeyond ornamentation, with each design created for a specific function. And while\r\n\r\nmodern origami relies on a square, rectangular or triangular shape, KG does not.\r\n\r\nThe \"Kai\" in KaiGami can mean cut in Japanese. To create a piece of KG\r\n\r\nsculptural design one must cut a profile, either symmetrical or asymmetrical, from\r\n\r\na piece of flat malleable material before the final process of creation begins. Once\r\n\r\ncut the profile is usually bent into shape rather than folded and it is this process\r\n\r\nthat gives each design its curves and volume ­ quite unlike origami's angular\r\n\r\nornaments. The KG method produces exciting designs all with a distinctive stylistic\r\n\r\nflavour!\r\n\r\nBritish Made\r\n\r\nIt's important to KaiGami that its designs are manufactured in house in the UK.\r\n\r\nWe know that this helps the local economy through job creation, and the export of\r\n\r\ngoods: and we're confident that it also means that you get top­quality products.\r\n\r\nOur carbon footprint reduced and our products can enter the market at\r\n\r\ncompetitive rates.\r\n\r\nSince laser technology is used to produce KaiGami products it is possible to offer a\r\n\r\nbespoke service to clients. If producing a client's desired design isn't possible in\r\n\r\nhouse,\r\n\r\nthen manufacturing will be outsourced, to local business wherever possible.\r\n\r\nWe wish to maintain Britain's reputation for producing classic designs and in so\r\n\r\ndoing to place KaiGami firmly on the map."

The story of Kerbholz begins in 2011: After Matthias & Moritz had been travelling along Central America for a while they rediscovered their love for wood. All along the way they had met the warm and haptic material: as a boat at the beach, as a terrace in the jungle or at the artisan markets of the indians.\r\n\r\nThe various ways of processing this warm and organic material filled them with enthusiasm and let no room for doubt: Wood needs a revi­val in each ones everyday street style!\r\n\r\nFrom this idea, sleepless nights, blood, sweat and tears, Kerb­holz finally arose in 2012. Since then, Kerbholz stands for wooden glasses and wooden watches of finest quality, handmade from the most precious woods in the world. Since the very beginning Kerbholz works in a sustainable way without compromising on the clean design or quality. With every sold Kerbholz product we´re giving back to what we love and plant a tree in central america. Sustainably, measurable and transparent.\r\n\r\nWith woody regards,\r\n\r\nAdrian, Matze, Moritz & Nils"

When fitting out their apartment in Berlin, label founders Sascha Janowsky and Frank Lenhart fruitlessly searched department stores for the right lighting fixtures and shades. Finding nothing to fit their needs, the duo took light creation into their own hands—Sascha worked on design, while Frank regulated the sales end of the burgeoning business. From there, their inspired label LJ Lamps was born, producing fascinating pieces in wood and concrete—and the rest, as they say, is history."

For whatever reason, she leaves the glucose monitor in her locker. Instead, she checks her Instagram.\r\n\r\nIn this scenario, Jordana needs two things: to check her glucose level and, on an immediate level, to be comforted. Instagram fulfills one of these needs, but what if there was a service that fulfilled both?\r\n\r\nLapka reimagines and redesigns the scientific devices used to do so as affordable, accessible and innovative accessories and services for self-care and mind harmony.

He had the idea to cut a spare piece of felt and sew it with his sneaker laces: the very first pair of Lasso slippers was born!\r\n\r\nOne hundred and sixty-four prototypes later the shape was perfected and the comfort optimized. Then Gaspard had the idea to keep them flat-packed so that anyone could assemble them with the laces of their choice. Back in Paris, he offered a pair to his friend Ruben to try out and see how he liked them. After sewing in the laces and experiencing Lasso for the first time, Ruben called Gaspard:\r\n\r\n« Mec, chaud patate !! On va les faire à Paris !»\r\nTo be translated by:\r\n« Mate, they are so warm, we’ve got to make them in Paris !»\r\n\r\nSo they started to look for a manufacturer and found the Sellerie Parisienne,at Villeneuve-Saint-Georges in the Parisian suburbs, a social enterprise that provides work opportunities for people with special needs. It offers all the skills needed to manufacture, package and ship Lasso to the customer. The die was cast! It took a lot more discussions, coffees, pints, sewing and sweat to establish Lasso: a young, social and conscientious brand. \r\n\r\nThe Lasso slippers were launched on Kickstarter in February 2013 and they managed to pre-sell 1852 pairs, so 344% of their initial target. They are now being worn in 40 different countries..."

She then studies art at two top schools, the ESAG Met de Penninghen and the Charpentier Academy in Paris. There, she learns about shapes, colors and typography which will naturally take her to work for an advertising agency as artistic director, during 6 years. But she realizes that becoming an adult is no fun. So, she gets down to work and decides to devote her spare time fighting against adulthood and seriousness. To postpone this dreaded eventuality, she decides to create a world in which adults look quirky, odd, kind of old fashioned with their mustaches and glasses. Simone thumbs her nose and pokes fun at daily life. Next, frustrated to only see her friends in one dimension, flat on a piece of paper, she becomes the proud owner of a sewing machine and soon designs and makes a whole collection of characters. Thus were born Jean-Louis, Rosalie and several others. And with them appears the trademark. Today the brand is distributed in over 10 countries."

Instead of waiting to have designs picked up by other brands Magnus Pettersen has always pushed into tangible prototypes without procrastinating. It’s simply more exciting that way. \r\n\r\nToday the making of products is something we take even more seriously. Any time a product transitions from sketchbook to a small product run, every last detail is scrutinised.\r\n\r\nConsidered design with attention to detail is our core value.\r\n\r\nThis stems from a merger of Scandinavian heritage with learning and living day-to-day on UK soil. Materialistically these influences become apparent too. We work with mixed materials, whether it’s metalwork inspired by British industrialism or wood inspired by the sprawling forests of Norway and beyond.\r\n\r\nOur style is contemporary, yet classic enough to be future proof. We create products to seamlessly co-exist within modern interiors. \r\n\r\nEverything we craft is well made. Quality is ensured through using traditional techniques and materials, from certified solid wood to mouth blown glass and carefully selected metals.\r\n\r\nEvery once in a while we will take more contemporary approaches using materials like concrete provided the inclusion heightens the overall design.\r\n\r\nWe strive to push design boundaries by challenging the way we utilise traditional manufacturing methods.\r\n\r\nMagnus Pettersen Studio is based in Hackney, London, UK."

The collections gather several lines of products: from ‘Artisanal’ pieces hand-made in the Paris atelier of the Maison to timeless classics, from radical accessories to casual clothes, from fashion to interior design, each of them complementing one another to compose a whole universe, way beyond a mere style. Besides the conception of its collections, the unique identity of the Maison has been clearly recognizable in its various spaces – from showrooms to shops – with signature elements such as the use of whites, cotton fabrics, “trompe-l’oeil”, mix of styles and époque, and hints of humor creating a distinctive atmosphere. Line 13 – objects & publications – was introduced in 1999 with a selection of home objects.\r\nA workshop artisan, inventor and professor in Paris (since 1993), François Azambourg has always worked for simplicity and lightness, which are the signature qualities of his work at first glance. His first subject of study was the weight and instability of the saxophone. He spent ten years improving upon its design and performance. Since then, his projects have focused on materials for the future as well as non-synthetic materials for industry, publishing and galleries. His research has resulted in creative designs for leather tables, skeletal chairs, openwork folded garden chairs, light fixtures with hair-like fiber optics and streetlights with long stems. The Two Propeller Mobile, each arm quivering at the slightest breath, was specially designed for “Exercises in air and wind”."

The result was the JTM45, an amp that reverberated with a sound that was much heavier than anything ever heard before. And in a twist of rock and roll fate, those guitarists, much like the Marshall name, would go on to revolutionize music forever. \r\nFifty years on, generations of guitarists and fans still revere the name.

Taking Japanese influences, the lamps are designed to be peaceful by using very clean lines and brilliant craftsmanship. As very tactile pieces, they bring a brilliant energy into any space."

As it's pronounced as [métə-foʊ], which subsequently reminds the sound of 'metaphor' in homonymous, the all work and projects indicate some implicit signifiers in order to convey new perspective and distinctive experience to people.\r\nIt may be inferred as cultural crossover, or mixture of art and craft, and ﻿blowing the boundary between archetypal tradition and modern design philosophy. Moreover, it doesn't just demolish the formal and trends, but recreate​ and reinvent them through eclectic, experimental methods.\r\nThe pleasure of intellectual thought-provoking, and such newness in ordinary life will be given through creative reinterpretation by METAFAUX."

Walter Miller moved to Lancaster PA and started his own plating business.  Shortly after, the company evolved into both a foundry and a lock making business.  Although both the plating and the lock making subsided in the 1930's, the foundry remains strong today, as a leader in the production of brass and bronze industrial castings.  Firmly situated in the middle of the Pennsylvania Dutch country, we carry on the same ideals and core values of honesty, loyalty, teamwork, integrity, and commitment that were started in 1887.\r\nThe experience we have gained over our one-hundred plus years is priceless and the one we share with our customers every day.\r\nMiller Cast Products marries yesteryear patterns and designs with the beauty of our sand-cast brass collectibles.  Our timeless appeal focuses on quality-handcrafted designs made by our artisans from the heartland of Central Pennsylvania.  We have chosen pieces to accentuate your personal or to give as a very special gift. \r\nMiller Cast Products is proud to continue the legacy of its founder by our long history of devotion to our customers."

A family business begun by Norwegian design pioneer and grandmother Gerd Hay-Edie, the traditional weaving techniques created on custom-made looms have been handed down to daughter Karen Hay-Edie before passing the baton onto her grandson, Mario Sierra. \r\n\r\nFrom humble beginnings in a small workshop in the late 1940s, Gerd’s name was soon to become a staple in mid-century British design through long standing collaborations with Robin Day for Hille and Terence Conran, producing specially designed upholstery and rugs. Her Tweed Emphasize and Mended Tweed fabrics were also celebrated within the fashion industry when they were shown as part of Irish designer Sybil Connolly’s 1956 Spring and Winter collections. \r\n\r\nBringing Mourne Textiles into the 21st century but staying true to the history and tradition of the workshop, Mourne continues to source much of their yarns from Donegal and custom dyes them to match the heritage pieces originally created by Gerd. These yarns are intrinsic to Mourne’s Irish-Scandinavian roots and with a rich and textured quality and warmth, their throws and cushions are a testament to Gerd’s classic style, standing the tests of time. \r\n"

The vision is that of creating a modern design company where designer and product go hand in hand from sketch to final object and further on to the retail stores. It is a story of young talents with a passion for design and a wish to make small changes.\r\n\r\nNordic Tales trade products in which both form and wrapping tell a tale. A tale, you as consumer contribute to by choosing for instance colour of a cord or size of a light bulb. It is a story that changes as you decide how to use your new product and its packaging. In this way you become part of the story of Nordic Tales and at the same time you create a unique and personal design for yourself.\r\n\r\nNordic Tales believe that quality design can easily grow from small ideas into great products through a process where both designer and consumer play a considerable role.

His refreshing approach has caught the buyers’ eyes at world-class retailers such as Liberty, V&A, Heal’s, Paul Smith and The Design Museum.

The NoMoreTwist project – a place for collective research as well as a brand of textile objects – came to fruition as their studies ended.\r\n\r\nThe brand’s DNA is textile. Each new production considers the thread itself, its thickness, texture, colour and, above all, the various ways of interlocking it. Developing different weaves is at the heart of NoMoreTwist’s work, posing a continual challenge to design new and amazing fabrics. They are then highlighted within collections of throws, cushions, large floor cushions,… And all 100% ‘made in Belgium.’                    \r\n\r\nWith this little characteristic ‘twist,’ the objects bring a touch of originality and colour, giving character to any interior.\r\n\r\nNoMoreTwist also offers its expertise to object designers, stylists or architects interested in tailored design.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nNoMoreTwist collections are auto-edited in small series. They are entirely created in Belgium.\r\n\r\nThe created objects highlight the woven textile which is the authentic DNA of the brand.The beginning of the creation process is always a thread itself and all his possibilities of arrangement in a textile. After researches on textile structures made in the studio, the patterns and the colors naturally take shape.\r\nNoMoreTwist collections are auto-edited in small series.

Says Otto, “We always jump on our bikes-\r\nwhatever the weather or occasion-because we believe it is the only way to get ourselves \r\n\r\naround! We love cycling as a way of transport and we know it keeps us fit and young, \r\n\r\nwithout a negative impact on the planet”\r\n\r\nOtto London was founded in response to a very British problem Eleo recalls: “We kept on \r\n\r\ngetting wet in London’s changeable weather because we couldn't find clothes which we \r\n\r\nreally wanted to wear that ofered us protection but didn't limit our freedom to ride”\r\n\r\nAfter a few samples and trials, the team came up with a very popular Urban Style Poncho \r\n\r\nwhich is a fusion of a traditional European capes with native Latin American ponchos with \r\n\r\na contemporary urban and functional twist.\r\n\r\nThe Otto London ethos is one of style and practicality. Garments are functional and full of \r\n\r\ncycling features, but it’s all wrapped in slick and minimal design language.\r\n\r\nPut simply, Otto London produces accessories for the smart urban cyclist who wants \r\n\r\npractical yet stylish alternatives to the obvious."

We can consider it a sort of counter-melody, or counterbalance to the overwhelming spread of digital technology. This return to analogue is not “vintage”, rather it  offers a radically new meaning to the individual experience of looking, contemplating time and representing space.

The games enable all players to examine the nature of the language of art and to observe the ways in which chance, intuition, curiosity and daring can lead to delightful, unexpected and sometimes unsettling experiences, even revealing intimate truths about ourselves that we may have been unaware of.\r\n\r\nPICO PAO is a workshop with a long history of craftsmanship that began in 1979 in Lubián, a small Spanish village nestled in the mountains on the border with Portugal. In the neighboring Portuguese county of Tras os Montes (“Beyond the Mountains”) the local woodpecker is known as PICO PAO (“Stick-Beak”). The song of this handsome green bird, which evokes the whinnying of a horse, alternates with the sound of his pecking at the trees as this resounds through the valley, blending in with the carpenters’ hammers as they work on the wooden roofs of the village houses. The old dwelling where the workshop originated offers a view of the entire valley, with wisps of smoke rising from the chimney tops and where every so often a Pico Pao can be seen flying gracefully towards the chestnut forests.\r\nSome time ago, a woman lived in this house with her six children. The poverty that these children grew up in, along with an industriousness and an ingenuity that enabled them to make use of virtually any material they came across, resulted in some of the finest, most desirable toys a child could wish for. Out of this resourcefulness and an admiration for the subsistence culture of these mountain villages grew this small workshop in Lubián. Here were made the first wooden replicas of old-fashioned toys, along with reproductions of the cameras used by the first street photographers and copies of traditional, pre-industrial looms.\r\nOver the years Javier Bermejo’s attention was increasingly drawn to a collection of old-fashioned toys and games, Juegos de la Antigüedad, of which he salvaged hundreds – of both European and African origin – from oblivion."

Riding 3 stories down and peeking under dust covers while marvelling at the shiny badges, forms and gorgeous paint finishes of the Countach, Muira and Dino. Discovering these thoroughbreds at a young age was integral to the growth of his obsession. 30 years on, Meagher now an award winning industrial designer and label owner harks back to those years of wonder by creating a line of timeless art-toys.\r\n\r\nWith decades of studying automotive styling cues and figuring out how cars are put together, Meagher hones his research into a coherent series of vehicles. Classics, Midi's, Mini's and Mavericks are an eclectic mix of Art, Fashion, Traditional Product Design, Modernism and of course Car Styling.\r\n\r\nMeagher’s long term collaborator, Cameron Treeby, an established industrial designer in his own right, has meticulously production engineered the entire line. The continued meeting of minds has allowed the creative direction of the label to venture further. Treeby works from our London office while Meagher works from his studio just outside Cape Town.\r\n\r\nWe have a manufacturing partner that truly understands quality and knows exactly what it takes to build beautiful products. We are not in the business of needless cost saving at the expense of performance and build quality. We choose to use the best materials available so the surfaces are flawless and the products are absolutely unrivalled.

Our mission is to bring a little bit of colour to urban streets and to restore the beauty and joy of cycling.

With understated, intricate patterns, each piece takes its role of bringing softness, texture and a playful and relaxed attitude to your home. \r\n\r\nContrary to the general trend, we have kept our entire production in Europe:\r\n- All our textiles are designed, printed and coated in Denmark.\r\n- All fine cotton items are made from 100% organically grown cotton, verified from harvesting through environmentally and socially responsible manufacturing.\r\n- Feather inner cushions are made in Denmark from partly recycled material. No feathers from living birds are used.\r\n- All bed linen is sewn and packaged at sheltered workshops in Denmark, all other styles are sewn and packaged in Lithuania.\r\n- All acrylic coating on oil cloth and canvas bags, laptop sleeves and purses is free from PVC and phtalates.\r\n- Our wool throws are made of 100% merino wool and woven in Lithuania."

Paul Räth, the founder of the company, was a man who knew quite clearly that education has a great deal to do with images.\r\n\r\nTwo globes from Paul Räth’s workshop are displayed today as first rate exhibits in museums today: what very well may be the first illuminated globe with electrical light from 1921 is exhibited in the Globe Museum of the Vienna National Library. A 64-cm diameter globe with a hand modeled surface relief first produced for a North German Lloyd luxury liner has adorned the collection of the German Museum in Munich since 1925.\r\n\r\nThe old-established Leipzig company has, albeit with some bitter sections, survived crises, wars, a planned economy and privatization, which speaks for the soundness of our products. \r\nHand laminated globes produced precisely by hand, continue to justify the predicate “Quality from Leipzig”.\r\nThe wide assortment of inexpensive globes also contributes to the company’s current success.\r\n"

Built with quality leather and hardware, each element is an expression of our ethos to live simply while paying attention to the details - which to us, mean bags that wear as great as they look. \r\n\r\nWhere did we come from?  Founder, Kristine Gottilla has been designing structured, smart leather accessories since she entered the handbag market with a test project in 2008. Over the past 5 years, she has fostered creative relationships with her customers by collaborating on custom orders, weaving projects here and abroad, and now with Spencer Devine.  All born out of a passion for design and creating things that people truly LOVE to wear. This evolving collection was born when Kristine realized that there was a need in the market for something more functional and stylish - a versatile staple bag that would meet the needs of the way we truly live in day to day life.\r\n\r\nMade in the USA.

          "brand_copy_description": "Simon Key Bertman is a textile artist and designer, living in Stockholm, who operates both nationally and internationally. With a sharp eye for pattern, texture and color Simon Key Bertman’s work has received considerable recognition over the past few years.\r\n\r\nTextiles aren’t just the sum of their fibers – they are the carriers of the ideas woven into their patterns. Bertman draws inspiration from two of his ancestors, writer and educator Ellen Key and renowned Swedish expressionist Isaac Grünewald.  Bertman’s high-quality and dynamically patterned mainly woven textiles bring instant movement to any space and show off the unique processes that led to their design, conceptual dimensions, mathematical sequences, and fascinating play with form and color.\r\n\r\nSimon Key Bertman has inspiration flowing through his veins; he creates fabrics that are more than simply decorative accents. The dynamic sequences of color, shading and form the designer uses in his handwoven cotton cushion covers reveal a complex line of thought, pulling playful experiments with color and mathematics together into unique textiles. Delving deeply into new dimensions while expanding the room with exquisite visual textures, each of Bertman’s creations add up to much more than just the sum of their fibers.\r\n\r\nThe focus of the artistic work is to extract and produce surface textures and patterns that in two or three dimensional textiles reflect a process, a mathematical thought and / or sometimes a game. Unique for the work of Simon Key Bertman is the underlying social codes that his weaving, textures and patterns represent, identify and problematize.\r\n\r\nIn the boundary between creating high quality products for everyday use and textile works for exhibitions and public spaces the focus is to continuously deepen and discuss what the pattern and structure of a textile object can represent and tell about its context or contemporaries.\r\n Every encounter between two threads or system of threads in the textile is unique and has a meaningful sense. They do not exist only to bind the textile, but because each thread and system of threads has a purpose and integrate into the system."

We first encountered some kooky Alpacas in the West of Ireland of all places, and were hooked. On doing our homework we learnt more and more about their incredible fleece, and next thing we were on a plane to Peru. Once we discovered how cosy things were there, we simply had to create our own boutique label – simple things™ was born. So, we began producing luxurious textiles of 100% alpaca for extravagance and warmth.\r\n\r\nWhile we are inspired by the extraordinary traditional craftsmanship of the Andes, we are neither Peruvian nor traditional craftsmen, so our exclusive range of alpaca goods are designed to appeal to contemporary tastes.\r\n\r\nSOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY: The farmers who deliver the alpaca wool to our weaving mill have organised themselves into communities that secure them a fair price for their work. Our weaving mill also educates the farmers in breeding methods. They therefore gain a greater profit for their effort and the quality of the alpaca wool is secured."

          "brand_copy_description": "23 years ago, when Cheryl and Barry Eldridge looked to diversify the farming activities on Stansborough, their New Zealand sheep station, they had no idea the results would eventually be seen on cinema screens around the world. The unique fibre created by their flock of rare grey sheep was used to costume many of the main characters appearing in the blockbuster movies 'The Lord of the Rings’ and 'The Hobbit'. \r\n\r\nIt was seen again in two major Disney productions, Narnia's - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and Prince Caspian; along with The Waterhorse, BBC's Kidnapped, Avatar and many others. This New Zealand couple says that producing the fabric for the ‘Fellowship Cloaks’ and major costuming in ‘The Lord of the Rings’ movies was their ultimate challenge and their biggest achievement to date.\r\n\r\nIn 1991, Cheryl and Barry concluded that their hill country sheep and cattle farm, situated in a picturesque valley in the Wairarapa, two hours drive from Wellington, was a marginal farming operation. With the downturn in farming at the time, the Eldridge’s looked for other imaginative options. Their search resulted in them obtaining a small flock of grey sheep, now registered as a wool breed in their own right,  'Stansborough Greys'. The Eldridge's also farm a herd of 80 alpacas,  have some forestry plantations and created some native bush reserves, to cancel out their carbon footprint. \r\n\r\nThey also produce a growing amount of high quality UMF honey on the property.\r\n\r\nTheir flock of blue grey sheep, now have wool that is unusually silky, soft and lustrous. This is the result of many years of selective breeding and hard work, producing a ' Stansborough Grey' flock of over twelve hundred animals, the only ones of their kind in the world. The alpacas on the farm produce fibre which adds warmth and a variety of other natural colours to many of the end products created at their weaving mill.  When on display in New York, the unusual qualities of the 'Stansborough Grey' fibre caught the eyes of the 'Lord of the Rings' costume designers and thus began their ongoing involvement in the Movie industry.\r\n\r\nThe Eldridge’s personally attend the shearing, hand sorting and grading of the fleece of each animal. After the fleece has been professionally worsted spun, the yarn is then woven at their own historic Weaving Mill in Wellington. 100% grown, inspired, designed and created in New Zealand, the end product is totally natural and eco friendly;  from the sustainable way the animals are farmed,  right through to the hand finished textiles. The fibres used are in totally natural or biodegradable overdyed colours only.\r\n\r\nCheryl , who has a background in the creative arts, along with daughter Kiri, designs all the fabrics, accessories and finished product range.  Barry Eldridge, along with Richard Graham the mill Manager,  draws on his engineering background to expertly operate the historic looms they use in their factory and hand finish the textiles.  \r\n\r\nThe looms, that came out to New Zealand in the early 1900’s , were developed in England in the 1890’s to make fine worsted textiles and are themselves masterpieces of design and engineering. These were among the very first commercial worsted looms manufactured, at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, and have the ability to still create heirloom textiles from a bygone era.\r\nCheryl and the team are constantly developing their range of original and unique fashion, interiors & baby products . \r\nThese are now marketed through high end outlets in UK, Europe, USA, Canada and Australia. They have created exclusive collections for SAKS Fifth Avenue,  Liberty's and David Jones.  Stansborough textiles can been seen on fashion cat walks in Australia and New Zealand. Cheryl has worked with some of the world's best Interior Designers around the world and furnished Super Yachts, Boutique Lodges and Designer Homes  in NZ and overseas. \r\n\r\nTheir Designer Blanket range has been gifted to VIP's worldwide,  and has the backing of Campaign for Wool - led by Prince Charles.  The Stansborough Label is now recognized on the world stage for its innovative and highly prized,  sustainable, textile creations.  \r\n\r\nWhat originally started out as an idea to keep a rare sheep from extinction and a farm operating profitably, has grown into a family business that begins out in the paddock and ends in high end fashion outlets and increasingly on blockbuster cinema screens."

Their ongoing process always begins with throwing a new material in the center of the design triangle- with new passion for new possibilities, and studying its DNA structure function- which leads to a new dialogue form.  The three designers always insist that the path itself be guided by a map of simplicity. \r\nThe design path of each new object is over when the threesome feel they have  achieved the learning experience that is latent in it, and only then they can move on to the next learning experience, the next material adventure.\r\n"

The cardboard playhouse with which we launched Kidsonroof – now a classic piece in many a children’s\r\nroom – was soon followed by a great many colourful doll’s houses, horses, dogs, dragonflies, and trees. Now, almost 10 years years down \r\nthe line, we proudly see that our creations are sold worldwide in the most beautiful shops.\r\n\r\nAnd, in 2013, alongside the paper products, there suddenly appeared a small collection of furniture. The roof had become too \r\nsmall… our studio had grown… Studio ROOF was born.\r\n \r\nIn 2014, Studio ROOF has come to fruition, and we now produce two collections: the Paper Creative Collection with paper 3D \r\nobjects, toys, and paperware for ALL ages, and the Living Collection, which consists of home accessories and furniture. The \r\nimagination is always the motive behind the two collections. And imagination is not bound by age. Our products are creations \r\nfor young and old, inviting them to tell stories to each other; to get inspiration; and to create new ambiances.\r\n\r\nRomy + Ilya and Studio ROOF team."

The letter \"T\" represents the \"T\" in Tami. \"Squared\" represents the modern urban geometrical design philosophy and approach.\r\n\r\nArchitecture, geometric lines, minimalism and monochromatic colors influence the T Squared designs. I draw inspiration from the urban architecture. The designs of T Squared create necklaces, bracelets, pendants rings and earrings that are versatile, elegant, and abstract.\r\n\r\nAll items are hand-made and created of various materials with use of monochromatic colors. Tami uses primarily silver, gold and anodized brass as well as soft materials such as polyester yarns, silk threads and silicone.\r\n\r\nIn 2014 Tami and industrial designer, Isaac Eskayo, renovated and designed a new studio in Jaffa to create and exhibit T Squared jewelry. \r\n\r\nThe Jaffa studio \"is a quiet place to get dirty.\" Tami enjoys working hands on with her jewellery.\r\n\r\nTami is not afraid to be genuine and vulnerable which is the essence of her design's clean simplicity. This simplicity brings subtle meaning and balance to one's look. There is a quiet delicate sophistication that complements one's own natural beauty. T Squared jewellery gives room for one's unique splendour.\r\n\r\n"

Our work is driven by our love for the materials and curiosity for their potential and limitations. With each of our pieces finished by hand, we are trying to add something very intimate within each of our trademark plywood designs. As a result, our products gain a personality of their own. The ones that we have created so far have become full-fledged members of our team and very often hint us towards new ideas. Together we have developed a style based on subtle contrasts and juxtapositions: smuggling organic themes into geometric modern shapes and balancing raw industrial touch with joyful colors. We try to stick to our crucial motto – to design and produce cool things. We really hope you will enjoy them as much as we do. TABANDA brand was found in 2009. Within six years of business, our collection of high quality furniture designs earned ever increasing recognition in Poland as well as on other european markets. Our projects made it to the pages of such magazines as Wallpaper, Elle Décor, ICON and designboom. Four of our products were also honoured with the Must Have recognition award during three consecutive editions of Łódż Design Festival. At Milan Design Week 2015, together with Ewa Solarz we have curated the “DO IT YOUR WAY – Polish design in pieces” interactive national exhibition that focused on contemporary Polish design. Few months earlier, Design Alive - magazine of fine ideas awarded us the Creator of the Year 2014 Award for organizing the “Test Zone” exhibition during Łódź Design Festival 2014.\r\n"

Years of research and experimentation allowed him to develop a new steaming method to turn his design visions into reality.\r\n\r\nTom was co-founder of the award-winning collective design company Sixixis, recognised for unique aesthetic, forward-thinking designs and now, through his own company, Tom continues to create spectacular, ecologically sound, innovative furniture and lighting.\r\n\r\nHandcrafted in his studios in Cornwall, England, the range of contemporary lighting and furniture Tom now creates is based on beauty, integrity and a desire to create unique, high-specification products that will be cherished by their owners.\r\n\r\nWinner of the Lighting Design Association’s Lighting Design Award 2011."

We come from different places like Switzerland, France, China and Taiwan and each one of us bring his cultural and know-how to design beautiful pieces and professional audio solutions. We come from different professional backgrounds such as audio engineering, manufacturing, and product design. We came together to grow something different that interest and challenge us.\r\nThe group was started with the desire to bring a different sound than what is on the market. Most portable speakers follow an American trend toward heavy bass and lackluster middles and highs frequencies (typically where the singing and most instruments are found). This type of sound is heavy on the ears and prolonged listening is physically tiring due to the fact that our ears try to compensate for the missing sounds and force our brains to constantly adjust to try to match its expectations. Our products try to balance all the sounds found in your music to provide a prolonged and enjoyable experience.\r\nMost companies nowadays outsource their sound development to third parties factories with very little involvement or expertise in sound development. They typically have strict launch dates which dictate when the product is finished in such a way that a good version of the product is never achieved.  An ‘acceptable” sound is typically what they think they can get away with and what they think the customer will accept. We develop our products from the ground up and maintain offices closely or within our supply chain. Each of our products goes through multiple generations and modifications phases until we are satisfied with our designs. We don’t have due dates, we have satisfaction for our ears.\r\nWe strive to bring different designs than what is found on the market, to give a broader choice to our customers and are not afraid to go after niche looks. We don’t go for a “brand look” or colors, we try to make each of our designs it’s own look and universe. We like to discover and grow designs without any preconception of what a Tree-Labs design should look like, because we think curiosity and tastes are ever changing the world over.\r\n\r\n "

With its products, the label U rbanature fills the gap in everyday life between city living and the longing for something more primal.\r\nUrbanisation is a global trend. While in developing and newly industrialised countries megacities are blooming and birth rates are skyrocketing, Germany , like other European countries, is suffering as a result of demographic change, and has been for decades. Germany is contracting - Less people are being born and life expectancy is increasing. A falling birth rate, unemployment and mass migration from rural areas threatens to turn those areas into an “ocean of poverty and dementia”, to quote the drastic assessment of some scientists. \r\nThis need not necessarily be a catastrophe. It is also possible to gain something positive from such change. The countryside is stagnating – nature is reclaiming lost ground. In Germany’s  Lusatia, wolves can be heard howling once more. Lynx can now be seen in the Harz mountains. Why should Germans go all the way to Tuscany? Holidaying in Germany is more popular than ever.\r\nBut for almost everybody, everyday life takes place not in Lusatia, nor in the Harz mountains, but in urban centres and metropolitan areas. It’s where the jobs, kindergartens and schools are. It’s where infrastructure and supply systems function perfectly. It’s home to the arts and culture – to civilisation!\r\nYet the yearning for green, for nature, for pristine beauty, cannot be satisfied by a few days’ holiday. Urban gardening, neighbourhood gardens, guerrilla gardening; these phenomena are all borne out of this longing. And scientists are seeking new ways to bring horticulture inside urban buildings, with one key thing in mind: More freshness, less travelling. This is why staff at Dresden’s Institute of Horticulture are working as hard  as they can to find solutions to the global trend – urbanisation . www.BrickBorn Farming.de\r\nThe label urbanature also attempts to bridge the gap between city life and the rural, in your own home. Urbanature is about products that render the everyday as green as possible. Urbanature brings a little piece of nature into our urban lives.\r\n\r\nThe label urbanature is a selection of product designer Jörg Brachmann’s ideas. It was founded in early 2013. His designs are inspired by a strong affinity with nature and a passion for cooking, and he has a real eye for the extraordinary. He turns his ideas into prototypes in his own studio on the outskirts of Leipzig, where he then perfects them before creating product series in his own workshops. In collaboration with regional craft specialists, he develops solutions that allow  his products to be manufactured in a way that is both economical and high-quality. He uses wood from sustainable forests as well as recyclable materials – even for the packaging. \r\nMade in Germany.\r\n\r\n"

Or maybe there was, but they were ... well, simply a bit boring. The ambition was – and still is – to offer something different as opposed to most of the accessories available today. To inspire you to dare cross the conservative line, break free and be a rebel without a pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUlterior Motive is more rock than business. Hell, yes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTies are an important part of our product range. When it comes to ties, our philosophy is that you can wear a tie almost anytime. We believe the reason why (almost) nobody does this today is that the ties that you find in stores are either meant for business or dinner parties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur question is - why can't you wear a tie at the weekend barbeque?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe products we design today have the goal to carry a subtle edge, not to be in-your-face, but rather something you notice in the details. We would never put out a t-shirt with just our logo, but most likely a woven skull on the back lining of a tie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the things we like: Pharell Williams, sixties airline logos, Iggy Pop, Oscar Niemey- er’s Brasil, Sir Paul Smith, the cover of Kraftwerk’s ”The Man- Machine” LP, Old Fashioned, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Don Draper & Co ..."

Thanks to the rotational moulding technology which had not been used in the Polish furniture industry so far, the historical model of the armchair was reproduced and now is available in two versions: matt version is the armchair with the seat made of polyethylene dyed in the cake, the classic version is the armchair with the seat made of polyethylene varnished to a high gloss. The precisely developed form constitutes a 100% replica of the original.\r\nThe nearest plans of the Vzór brand include other models designed by Roman Modzelewski."

We don’t see the concept of sustainability as a passing phase, we view it as our very foundation.\r\n\r\nSebastian Jørgensen is the designer behind We Do Wood. As a trained furniture- and cabinetmaker, Sebastian is an experienced craftsman. However, Sebastian's understanding of design originally comes from the world of art, which creates a different approach than most. Sebastian’s design process is a bit like painting: he usually make a sketch and goes directly to the workshop to make 1:1 mock ups and prototypes. Eventually Sebastian uses his background as a cabinetmaker to prepare the piece for industrial production.\r\nCommon for the two approaches is, however, the desire to move boundaries and give the craft of cabinetmaking a new twist – in terms of design but especially in terms of responsibility. \r\n\r\nBecause We Do Wood is not just about furniture - it's also about respect, changes and common sense."

Next to his collaboration with several national and international companies he launched an own collection of furniture in 2011.PRIVATE SPACE FURNITURE COLLECTION  -  furniture for home + hotel + office\tSince living room and kitchen have been growing together as the public spaces of a private home, the PRIVATE SPACE furniture collection meets the same trend taking place at the private areas such as bathroom and bedroom. Clear and straight design, soft white in combination with natural wood and open space interior arrangements create an atmosphere of comfort, ease and recreation.Whereas washstand, bench or bed of the PRIVATE SPACE furniture collection combine bath- and bedroom to the private zone of an apartment, the collection also extends to the \"public\" space of a home, which is the place you share with your guests. Well suitable for office use also, the clear and straight designs of these furniture pick up traditional timber joints, but still create a modern atmosphere of comfort and ease.THE MAKING OF DESIGNA good idea has no value without the perfect teamwork of everyone being involved in its realization. \"I always try to add a warm touch of ease and recreation to my designs in contrast to the stressful outside world.\" That is why Jannis Ellenberger continues to use wood as a natural material for his works. Designed with a lot of care and sensitivity he realized the PRIVATE SPACE collection in close cooperation with furniture manufacturer Anders GmbH. Combining modern serial production with strong quality controls, all items of the collection are manufactured under one roof. Processing solid wood requires not only special knowledge and experience, but also a passion for the material - a true basis for furniture that last more than a lifetime."

The firm’s activities started in 2007, ranging from market analysis to defining concepts, to project engineering, and graphic design analysis of media for launching products to the market. Their approach to projects is aimed at creating poetic objects that tell something to those who observe them, creating a little magic with their designs so as to make every room, place, or environment an enjoyable place to be. They believe that every object which is able to draw a smile contains within it a little spell and so has a reason to exist in a market already overflowing with objects."

The starting point was an accidental collaboration that lead to the discovery of an adjustable aperture mechanism that can sculpt and shape light. As it is adjusted, the iris-like light fixture dramatically changes the environment of a space through the volume of direct light it emits, as well as the complex light textures it projects onto space (patent 8,025,430).\r\n\r\nLater that year, ceramic artist Sharan Elran joined lightexture and expanded the pallet and vocabulary of materials into clay and porcelain. Together the three designers - an architect, a lighting designer and ceramic artist - have been collaborating to create a robust collection of fixtures that are both playful and sensual. Each of the partner designers brings in a different set of skills and sensibilities to the stage, which makes the lights a conversation through work."

The customer can choose from different objects or design a unique one. Nearly any form is possible. In a second step the 3d computer model gets transformed into a flat plan. This flat plan gets printed on heavy paper with a standard oversize printer used in architecture offices. The printout gets turned over to the customer. In the last step the customer cuts out, folds and glues the parts together. \r\nAt the fair “Maison&Objet” in Paris \"\"mostlikely\"\" won the „Prix Découvertes MAISON&OBJET 2012“. \"\r\n"

On closer inspection, the design bureau treats functional home electronics as a ruse for design-pranksterism.\r\n\r\nEach of the concrete blocks, and their corresponding colors, are derived from the colorways and shapes of tetris. It's no coincidence that Tetris was one of the USSR's largest cultural exports to the west, either--what other material pays homage to the USSR than beton brut? Taken together, what we have are 8kg concrete blocks that help transmit a nearly immaterial form of energy; digitally derived forms made manifest in one of the heaviest materials there is (that won't give you cancer, at least); power cords that would fit in any post-soviet plattenbau, right down to the juxtaposition of cheery colors with cold cast concrete.\r\n\r\nHand cast in Berlin, these also happen to be functional powerstrips."

It is a mindset that most of us somehow lost. As a result of our busy lifestyles, we often forget that we actually have a choice of how to live. The slow watch (we named it slow Jo) is a subtle reminder that time is the most precious thing we have so we should enjoy everything we do and stop chasing every minute. In order to be a true symbol of this idea, the slow watch has only one hand that rotates once every 24 hours. It actually moves at half the speed of a normal watch, but allows you to see at one glance the progress of your entire day. "

He currently works as a product designer and a 3d visual developer\r\nbetween Italy and Serbia, and he still looks for a contamination between different design\r\nfields as the most worthwhile approach to the projects he develops. He has been exposing\r\nhis prototypes in Belgrade and at the Salone del Mobile of Milan (“Creative Space Serbia”\r\nexposition, 2012 - 2013). In 2012 he has found Twentythree, design studio with highest aim\r\nto establish production and design hubs altogether, delivering new ideas and good solutions\r\nall over the world."

She founded we shop, where her dedication for design is carried out in creating furniture and home accessories."
